This repository presents predictive analytics projects implemented in R like the exploratory analysis of the Boston Housing dataset, identifying key relationships and outliers and a simulation study demonstrating the behavior of Population vs Sample Regression and OLS minimization of RSS.Using the ISLR Credit dataset, multiple regression models with quantitative and qualitative predictors were built, interpreted, and compared using Adjusted R², AIC, BIC, and VIF to diagnose multicollinearity.Non-linear polynomial regression has also been used to check if model performance improves.
